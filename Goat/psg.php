    <p style="color: white; line-height:40px; margin-right:10%;margin-left:10%; ">On 10 August 2021, Messi joined French club Paris Saint-Germain (PSG),[90] on a two-year deal until June 2023 with an option for an extra year.[91] Messi chose 30 as his squad number, the same he wore as a teenager when he made his senior debut for Barcelona.[92]

On 29 November, having scored 40 goals at club and international level for the calendar year and helped Argentina win the 2021 Copa América, Messi received a record seventh Ballon d'Or.[93] He finished his debut season with PSG with 11 goals and 14 assists across all competitions.[94]

In the 2022–23 season, he had the highest number of assists in the league with 16, and was included in the UNFP's Ligue 1 Team of the Season alongside teammates Achraf Hakimi, Nuno Mendes and Mbappé.[95][96] On 28 May, he scored in a 1–1 draw against Strasbourg, helping PSG clinch their 11th Ligue 1 title and his second in a row. At the end of the season, he departed for Inter Miami.</p>

    <p style="color: white; line-height:40px; margin-right:10%;margin-left:10%; ">The Argentine, who was crowned world champion with his national team this season, is leaving Paris at the end of the current season. Leo Messi now joins the ranks of those who have entered into Paris Saint-Germain legend.

A legend who continues to write his legend. Lionel Messi has left his mark on the history of Paris Saint-Germain for a number of reasons and, as you would expect, La Pulga has left an indelible mark on the history of football.</p>

    <p style="color: white; line-height:40px; margin-right:10%;margin-left:10%; ">A new life for the man who spent almost his entire career at Barcelona, winning everything in his path. It's a new life that he has been groping his way through, during a first season that would be crowned with his first French league title - the tenth in the club's history - and the Ballon d'Or - his seventh - a unique achievement that is likely to remain etched in stone.

The following season saw a double consecration, with the 11th title won by the capital club, an historic title that made Les Rouge et Bleu the absolute kings of France. The title was also won thanks to Messi, whose impressive tally of 21 goals in all competitions, and 16 assists in Ligue 1 alone, made him the club leader for goal involvements. The Argentine was crowned the league's assists leader this season, taking the baton from team-mate Kylian Mbappé, who won the award last year. Messi is also joint-assists leader in Europe's top five leagues this season, on par with Kevin De Bruyne (Manchester City).</p>
