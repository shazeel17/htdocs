    <p style="color: white; line-height:40px; margin-right:10%;margin-left:10%; ">Lionel Messi is “close” to returning from his ankle injury and is expected to play for Inter Miami CF before the end of the 2024 MLS regular season, head coach Gerardo 'Tata' Martino said Friday.

Messi, who got injured last month as Argentina won a second-straight Copa América title, began training individually four days ago. Martino feels Messi is "evolving well" as he regains fitness.

"There is no estimated date [for his return] because we’ll start seeing how he feels as he trains more on the pitch," Tata told reporters.</p>
