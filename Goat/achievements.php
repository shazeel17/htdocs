    <p class="leo-info">The European Golden Shoe is awarded to the top goalscorer in Europe. It is awarded based on a weighted points system that allows players in tougher leagues to win even if they score fewer goals than a player in a weaker league. Goals scored in the top five leagues according to the UEFA coefficients rankings are multiplied by a factor of two, and goals scored in the leagues ranked six to 21 are multiplied by 1.5.

Since the points system was established in 1996, Messi is the only player to win the award a record six times and also the only one to win it with a record 100 points (season 2011–12). Messi was also the first player to win the award five times.[149][150][151]</p>
